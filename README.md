# TPN-Network-Framework
Quite a lot of 'work', innit? ðŸ‘€

This framework will contain all the functions related to network. Most of those functions work by conventions (interface contracts), and must be manipulated with care.

Once again, all the functions in this framework must be exhaustively documented. At least one example for each function is expected here as well.
